# MCP Tools for Generation

Custom MCP tools that opencode can use during generation:
- **web_search** — verify claims, find additional context
- **fetch_url** — retrieve full text of linked articles
- **translate** — translate foreign-language content
- **query_content_store** — query pail's content store for related items from other time windows

These would be registered as MCP servers in the opencode invocation, giving the AI agent tool access during digest generation.
